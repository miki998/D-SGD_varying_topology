## Description
Our code is largely notebook based to show plots and results relayed in the report. 
Main points are as follows:
    
    - iid distribution for D-SGD for various topology (part 1)
    - non-iid distribution for D-SGD for various topology (part 2)
    - non-iid distribution for D-SGD for iteratively modified starting topologies (part 3)

And our report `report.pdf` summarizes our ideas.
